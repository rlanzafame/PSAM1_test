Thus, the Public Authority in the area wants to know how vulnerable those fields are. Would you help them calculate the probability of the tulips being damaged in a given year, $ P(A)$? Fortunately, you have already been provided historic data from which you can derive probabilities of bad events happening, $P(B_i)$, as well as the probability that such an event leads to damage, $P(A|B_i)$, which are summarized below.  \n",

    "First, there may be a regional drought with a probability $ P(B_1)=0.05$ or a pipe in the supply system may break with a probability $P(B_2)=0.10$. There is a chance of $P(A|B_1)=0.65$ and $P(A|B_2)=0.55$ that tulips won’t grow if the regional drought or the pipe breakage happens, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "There may also be a human error in the operation of the water supply system, $P(B_3)=0.03$, which may make tulips be too dry or too wet and results in rotten tulips with a probability $P(A|B_3)=0.90$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility is that the stored water to ensure the supply may get polluted, $P(B_4)=0.05$, leading to a lack of water for the tulips with chance $P(A|B_4)=0.70$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, catastrophes can happen! There may be a plague or a fire that occurs with probabilities $P(B_5)=0.03$ and $P(B_6)=0.05$, respectively. Those can lead to damage in the tulips field with probabilities $P(A|B_5)=0.80$ and $P(A|B_6)=0.90$.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is because the cause which contributes the most to the damages in the fields is the pipe breakage in the supply system. Thus, **improving their maintenance** may be one way to reduce $P(B_2)$. We could also try to reduce the value of  $P(A|B_2)$. Since this value is conditional on broken pipes, it obviously is a function of what happens at the tulip farm after the pipe breaks, for example, a leaky pipe detection system, or a backup water delivery system. If we can address those parts of the entire tulip growing system we can effectively reduce the overall probability of tulip damage."
